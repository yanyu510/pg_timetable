pg_timetable: Advanced scheduling for PostgreSQL
================================================

**pg_timetable** is an advanced job scheduler for PostgreSQL, offering many advantages over traditional schedulers such as **cron** and others.
It is completely database driven and provides a couple of advanced concepts.

```terminal
# ./pg_timetable

Application Options:
  -c, --clientname=               Unique name for application instance
  -v, --verbose                   Show verbose debug information [$PGTT_VERBOSE]
  -h, --host=                     PG config DB host (default: localhost) [$PGTT_PGHOST]
  -p, --port=                     PG config DB port (default: 5432) [$PGTT_PGPORT]
  -d, --dbname=                   PG config DB dbname (default: timetable) [$PGTT_PGDATABASE]
  -u, --user=                     PG config DB user (default: scheduler) [$PGTT_PGUSER]
  -f, --file=                     SQL script file to execute during startup
  -t, --refetch-timeout=          The main loop period (default: 60)
      --password=                 PG config DB password (default: somestrong) [$PGTT_PGPASSWORD]
      --sslmode=[disable|require] What SSL priority use for connection (default: disable)
      --pgurl=                    PG config DB url [$PGTT_URL]
      --init                      Initialize database schema and exit. Can be used with --upgrade
      --upgrade                   Upgrade database to the latest version
      --no-program-tasks            Disable executing of PROGRAM tasks [$PGTT_NOPROGRAMTASKS]
```

```sh
wget -O pg_timetable.Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybertec-postgresql/pg_timetable/master/Dockerfile
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```sh
podman build -f pg_timetable.Dockerfile -t pg_timetable:latest
```

3. Run the image:

```sh
podman run --rm pg_timetable:latest
```

4. To pass additional arguments to pg_timetable, such as where your database is located, simply attach the flags to the `podman run`, like so:

```sh
podman run --rm pg_timetable:latest -h 10.0.0.3 -p 54321
```

### 2.3 Build from sources

```
Alternatively, run tests using postgres docker image:
```sh
$ RUN_DOCKER=true go test ./...
```


## 3. Features and advanced functionality

The scheduling in **pg_timetable** encompasses *three* different stages to facilitate the reuse with other parameters or additional schedules.


The first stage, ***base_task***, defines what to do.\
The second stage, ***task_chain***, contains a list of base tasks to run sequentially.\
The third stage consists of the ***chain_execution_config*** and defines *if*, *when*, and *how often* a chain should be executed.

Additionally, to provide the base tasks with parameters and influence their behavior, each entry in a task chain can be accompanied by an ***execution parameter***.

### 3.1. Base task

In **pg_timetable**, the most basic building block is a ***base task***. Currently, there are three different kinds of task:

| Base task kind   | Task kind type | Example                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SQL snippet      | `SQL`          | Starting a cleanup, refreshing a materialized view or processing data.                                                                                              |
| External program | `PROGRAM`        | Anything that can be called as an external binary, including shells, e.g. `bash`, `pwsh`, etc. |                                                                                                                  |
| Internal Task    | `BUILTIN`      | A prebuilt functionality included in **pg_timetable**. These include: <ul style="margin-top:12px"><li>Sleep</li><li>Log</li><li>SendMail</li><li>Download</li></ul> |

A new base task can be created by inserting a new entry into `timetable.base_task`.

<p align="center">Excerpt of <code>timetable.base_task</code></p>

| Column   | Type                  | Definition                                                              |
| :------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`   | `text`                | The name of the base task.                                              |
| `kind`   | `timetable.task_kind` | The type of the base task. Can be `SQL`(default), `PROGRAM` or `BUILTIN`. |
| `script` | `text`                | Contains either a SQL script or a command string which will be executed.|

### 3.2. Task chain

The next building block is a ***chain***, which simply represents a list of tasks. An example would be:

- Download files from a server
- Import files
- Run aggregations
- Commit the transaction
- Remove the files from disk

All tasks of the chain in **pg_timetable** are executed within one transaction. However, please, pay attention there is no opportunity to rollback `PROGRAM` and `BUILTIN` tasks.

<p align="center">Excerpt of <code>timetable.task_chain</code></p>

| Column                | Type      | Definition                                                                        |
| :-------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parent_id`           | `bigint`  | The ID of the previous chain task.  Set this to `NULL` if it is the first base task in the chain.|
| `task_id`             | `bigint`  | The ID of the **base task**.                                                      |
| `run_uid`             | `text`    | The role as which the chain should be executed as.                                |
| `database_connection` | `integer` | The ID of the `timetable.database_connection` that should be used.                |
| `ignore_error`        | `boolean` | Specify if the chain should resume after encountering an error (default: `false`).|


If the chain has been configured with `ignore_error` set to `true` (the default value is `false`), the worker process will report a success on execution *even if the task within the chain fails*.


#### 3.2.1. Chain execution configuration

Once a chain has been created, it has to be scheduled. For this, **pg_timetable** builds upon the standard **cron**-string, all the while adding multiple configuration options.

<p align="center">Excerpt of <code>timetable.chain_execution_config</code></p>

| Column                        | Type             | Definition  |
| :---------------------------  | :--------------- | :---------- |
| `chain_id`                    | `bigint`         | The id of the task chain. |
| `chain_name`                  | `text`           | The name of the chain. |
| `run_at`                      | `timetable.cron` | To achieve the `cron` equivalent of \*, set the value to `NULL`. |
| `max_instances`               | `integer`        | The amount of instances that this chain may have running at the same time. |
| `live`                        | `boolean`        | Control if the chain may be executed once it reaches its schedule. |
| `self_destruct`               | `boolean`        | Self destruct the chain. |
| `exclusive_execution`         | `boolean`        | Specifies whether the chain should be executed exclusively while all other chains are paused. |
| `excluded_execution_configs`  | `integer[]`      | TODO |
| `client_name`                 | `text`           | Specifies which client should execute the chain. Set this to `NULL` to allow any client. |



#### 3.2.2. Chain execution parameters

As mentioned above, base tasks are simple skeletons (e.g. *send email*, *vacuum*, etc.).
In most cases, they have to be brought to live by passing parameters to the execution.

<p align="center">Excerpt of <code>timetable.chain_execution_parameters</code></p>

| Column                   | Type    | Definition                                       |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `chain_execution_config` | `bigint`  | The ID of the chain execution configuration.     |
| `chain_id`               | `bigint`  | The ID of the chain.                             |
| `order_id`               | `integer` | The order of the parameter.                      |
| `value`                  | `jsonb`   | A `string` JSON array containing the parameters. |

### 3.3 Example usages

A variety of examples can be found in the `/samples` directory.

### 3.4 Example functions
Create a Job with the `timetable.job_add` function. With this function you can add a new one step chain with a cron-syntax.

| Parameter                   | Type    | Definition                                       | Default |
| :----------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |:---------|
| `task_name`     | `text`  | The name of the Task ||
| `task_function` | `text`  | The function which will be executed. ||
| `client_name`   | `text`  | Specifies which client should execute the chain. Set this to `NULL` to allow any client. |NULL|
| `task_type`     | `text`  | Type of the function `SQL`,`PROGRAM` and `BUILTIN` |SQL|
| `run_at`        | `timetable.cron`  | Time schedule in сron syntax. `NULL` stands for `'* * * * *'`     |NULL|
| `max_instances` | `integer` | The amount of instances that this chain may have running at the same time. |NULL|
| `live`          | `boolean` | Control if the chain may be executed once it reaches its schedule. |FALSE|
| `self_destruct` | `boolean` | Self destruct the chain. |FALSE|

#### 3.5 Usage

Run "MyJob" at 00:05 in August.
```SELECT timetable.job_add('MyJob', 'SELECT public.my_func()' , NULL, 'SQL', '5 0 * 8 *');```

Run "MyJob" at minute 23 past every 2nd hour from 0 through 20.
```SELECT timetable.job_add('MyJob', 'SELECT public.my_func()' , NULL, 'SQL', '23 0-20/2 * * *');```
    
## 4. Database logging and transactions

The entire activity of **pg_timetable** is logged in database tables (`timetable.log` and `timetable.execution_log`). Since there is no need to parse files when accessing log data, the representation through an UI can be easily achieved.

Furthermore, this behavior allows a remote host to access the log in a straightforward manner, simplifying large and/or distributed applications.
>Note: Logs are written in a separate transaction, in case the chain fails.

## 5. Runtime information

In order to examine the activity of **pg_timetable**, the table `timetable.run_status` can be queried. It contains information about active jobs and their current parameters.
